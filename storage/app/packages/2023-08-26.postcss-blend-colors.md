The PostCSS Blend Colors plugin is designed to simplify the process of blending colors within CSS declarations. It utilizes the chroma-js library to perform color blending operations, allowing developers to define custom color blends using
a mix() function in their stylesheets.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this plugin is to provide a seamless way for web developers to incorporate custom color blending effects into their stylesheets. While CSS already supports basic color blending modes, the mix() function allows
developers to define their own blending ratios and apply them to various color formats. This flexibility enables designers to create unique and visually appealing color transitions that go beyond the default CSS blending options.

## Installation

To use this plugin, you need to have Tailwind CSS installed in your project. If you haven't installed Tailwind CSS yet, follow these steps:

#### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add -D postcss-blend-colors
```

#### Using npm

```bash
npm install postcss-blend-colors --save-dev
```

#### Using yarn

```bash
yarn add -D postcss-blend-colors
```

## How to set up

### In postcss.config.js

```javascript
module.exports = {
    plugins: {
        "postcss-blend-colors": {}
    }
}
```

### In css

```css
body {
    background: mix('blue', 'red', 0.5);
}
```

### Converted output

```css
body {
    background: #800080;
}
```
