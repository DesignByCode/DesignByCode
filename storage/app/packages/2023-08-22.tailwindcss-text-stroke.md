## Use

The Text Stroke plugin provides the following utility classes for styling text with stroke effects:

* ```.text-stroke```: Base component that sets the default text stroke styles. You can override these styles using CSS variables.
* ```.text-stroke-{value}```: Sets the stroke width to the specified {value}. The available options are defined in the textStrokeWidth theme configuration.
* ```.text-stroke-{color}```: Applies a custom color to the text stroke. The {color} should match a color in your TailwindCSS color palette.
* ```.text-stroke-fill-{color}```: Applies a custom fill color to the text stroke. The {color} should match a color in your TailwindCSS color palette.

### Example

Here's an example of how you can use the utility classes to apply image masks:

```html
<h1 class="text-7xl font-black text-stroke">
  Hello, TailwindCSS
</h1>
```

### With modifiers

```html
<h1 class="text-7xl font-black text-stroke text-stroke-indigo-200 text-stroke-fill-indigo-600">
  Hello, TailwindCSS
</h1>
```
